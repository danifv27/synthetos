# synthetos

The application is designed to be highly modular and flexible, with a focus on testability and maintainability. It follows the principles of clean architecture, which means that it is organized into layers that are decoupled from one another and can be easily swapped out or replaced without affecting the overall functionality of the system.

At the core of the application is the business logic layer, which contains all the domain-specific code that drives the application's behavior. This layer is responsible for implementing the use cases and business rules of the application, and it communicates with the outside world through well-defined interfaces.

On top of the business logic layer is the application layer, which provides a high-level API for interacting with the system. This layer is responsible for translating user requests into actions that can be performed by the business logic layer, and it handles things like input validation and error handling.

The CLI component of the application is built on top of the application layer, providing a command-line interface that users can interact with to perform various actions. The CLI is designed to be simple and intuitive, with clear and concise commands that users can easily remember and use.

Overall, this Golang CLI application is a powerful and flexible tool for building robust, scalable systems that are easy to test and maintain. Its clean architecture and modular design make it highly adaptable to a wide range of use cases, and its Prometheus exporter provides valuable insights into system performance and behavior.
